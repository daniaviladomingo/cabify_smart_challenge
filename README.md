# Cabify Mobile Challenge

Besides providing exceptional transportation services, Cabify also runs a physical store which sells (only) 3 products:

```
Code         | Name                |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
VOUCHER      | Cabify Voucher      |   5.00€
TSHIRT       | Cabify T-Shirt      |  20.00€
MUG          | Cabify Coffee Mug   |   7.50€
```

Various departments have insisted on the following discounts:

 * The marketing department believes in 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on `VOUCHER` items.

 * The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy 3 or more `TSHIRT` items, the price per unit should be 19.00€.

Cabify's checkout process allows for items to be scanned in any order, and should return the total amount to be paid.

Examples:

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, MUG
    Total: 32.50€

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, VOUCHER
    Total: 25.00€

    Items: TSHIRT, TSHIRT, TSHIRT, VOUCHER, TSHIRT
    Total: 81.00€

    Items: VOUCHER, TSHIRT, VOUCHER, VOUCHER, MUG, TSHIRT, TSHIRT
    Total: 74.50€


# To do
Implement an app where a user can pick products from a list and checkout them to get the resulting price. You should get the list of products from [here](https://api.myjson.com/bins/4bwec). We don't need complex animations or layouts, but it should be functional and easy to use.

In Cabify we use Swift 4 to build our iOS app and Kotlin to build our Android app, but we want you to feel comfortable during the exercise, so feel free to pick the best platform for you: Swift/Objective-C or Kotlin/Java


**The code should:**
- Be written as production-ready code. You will write production code.
- Be easy to grow and easy to add new functionality.
- Have notes attached, explaning the solution and why certain things are included and others are left out.
